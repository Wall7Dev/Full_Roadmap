        Although the basics of HTML is plain text, we need a bit more to make it
        a nice and shiny HTML document.
      </p>

      <h2>Tags</h2>

      <p>
        The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround
        content and apply meaning to it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Change your document so that it looks like this:</p>
      <img src="./displayImg1.png" width="700" alt="display text one" />
      <br />

      <p>
        Now save the document again, go back to the web browser and reload the
        page.
      </p>

      <p>
        The appearance of the page will not have changed at all, but the purpose
        of HTML is to apply meaning, not presentation, and this example has now
        defined some fundamental elements of a web page.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first line on the top, <!DOCTYPE html>, is a document type
        declaration and it lets the browser know which flavor of HTML you’re
        using (HTML5, in this case). It’s very important to stick this in - If
        you don’t, browsers will assume you don’t really know what you’re doing
        and act in a very peculiar way.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get back to the point,
        <html>
          is the opening tag that kicks things off and tells the browser that
          everything between that and the
        </html>
        closing tag is an HTML document. The stuff between
        <body>
          and
        </body>
        is the main content of the document that will appear in the browser
        window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./ads.png" width="700" alt="ads_banner" />
      </p>

      <h2>Closing tags</h2>

      <p>
        The </body> and </html> put a close to their respective elements (more on elements in a moment).
      </p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
