    <h1>Concepts In HTML 5</h1>
    <p>Here's a breakdown of various key concepts in HTML5 with explanations and examples:
    </p>
    <hr />

    
    
    <ol>
      <h2>
        <li>
          Semantic Elements - <a href="./public/absolut_relative-paths.html">Concept Page</a>
        </li>
      </h2>
      <p>Concept: HTML5 introduces semantic elements that describe the content's meaning rather than just its appearance. This improves accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
        Examples:
      </p>
      <pre>
         <strong>header</strong> Represents the introductory content of a section, like a page header.
         <strong>nav</strong>: Defines a navigation section or a menu for the page.
         <strong>main</strong>: Indicates the main content of the document.
         <strong>article</strong>: Represents a self-contained piece of content, like a blog post or news article.
         <strong>section</strong>: Defines a generic section of a document, often used with a heading.
      </pre>

      <h2>
        <li>
          Canvas - <a href="./public/anniversary-project.html">Concept Page</a>
        </li>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Concept: Provides a way to create graphics and animations directly on the web page using JavaScript.
      </p>
        <pre>
          Example: You can use  <strong>canvas</strong> to create interactive charts, games, or dynamic drawings.
        </pre>

        <h2>
          <li>
            Web Storage: - <a href="./public/attributes-page.html">Concept Page</a>
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Concept: Allows storing data locally on the user's device using Local Storage or Session Storage.
        </p>
        <pre>
          Example: Local Storage can be used to save user preferences (e.g., theme color) that persist even after closing the browser. Session Storage can be used to store temporary data (e.g., shopping cart contents) that gets cleared when the browser window is closed.
        </pre>


        <h2>
          <li>
            Offline Capabilities: - <a href="./public/nestling-concept.html">Concept Page</a>
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Concept: Enables web applications to work even when the user is offline. This involves techniques like caching data and service workers.

        </p>
        <pre>
          Example: An offline-capable to-do list app might store tasks locally and sync them with the server when an internet connection becomes available.
        </pre>

        <h2>
          <li>
            Forms: - <a href="./public/list-concept.html">Concept Page</a>
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Concept: Improved form elements like;<br />
          email- <input type="email"> <br />
          <br />
          date-  <input type="date"> <br />
          <br />
          search- <input type="search"> <br />
          <br />
          for specific data input and validation.
        </p>
        <pre>
          Example: Using <input type="email"> ensures the user enters a valid email format before submission.
        </pre>

        <p>
          6. Audio and Video:

Concept: Native <audio> and <video> elements for embedding audio and video content without relying on plugins.
Example: You can directly embed an MP3 audio file or an MP4 video file in your web page for playback.
7. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):

Concept: Allows incorporating scalable vector graphics directly into web pages, ensuring clarity at any size.
Example: You can use SVG for logos, icons, or complex illustrations that remain sharp on different screen resolutions.
8. New Form Validation:

Concept: HTML5 introduces built-in validation attributes for form elements (e.g., required, pattern) to improve user experience and prevent invalid data submission.
Example: Using required on an email input field makes it mandatory for the user to enter an email address.
9. Microdata:

Concept: Allows embedding rich metadata within your HTML content, making it more understandable by search engines and other applications.
Example: You can use microdata to specify product details, contact information, or event schedules on your web page.
10. Geolocation:

Concept: Provides access to the user's location information (with permission) using JavaScript.
Example: A weather app might use geolocation to display the user's local weather forecast.
These are just some of the many concepts introduced in HTML5. By incorporating these elements and features, you can create richer, more interactive, and user-friendly web experiences.

      William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet,
      painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is
      now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual
      art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by
      20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its
      merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His
      visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him
      "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002,
      Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
      Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except for three
      years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich
      collection of works, which embraced the imagination as "the body of
      God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic
      views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness
      and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents
      within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part
      of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has been
      said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9]
      A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to
      almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the
      ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11]
      Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an
      amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also
      influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known
      influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to
      classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised
      him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not forestalled by
      predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by
      known or readily surmisable successors".[14]
