    <h2>Concept 1 - <a href="#">Tags</a></h2>
    <p>
      Tags are building blocks of the HTML structure. Tags can be;
      <pre>
      <strong>open</strong> (eg: [<br />, <img />]) or
      <storng>close</storng> tags ([examples: <html])>, header tags</pre>
    </p>

        In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
        presence or absence of prompts <b>(>>> and …):</b> to repeat the
        example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt
        appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the
        interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an
        example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a
        multi-line command.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in
        the upper-right corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and
        output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input
        lines into your interpreter.

      William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet,
      painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is
      now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual
      art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by
      20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its
      merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His
      visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him
      "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002,
      Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
      Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except for three
      years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich
      collection of works, which embraced the imagination as "the body of
      God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]

      Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic
      views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness
      and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents
      within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part
      of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has been
      said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9]
      A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to
      almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the
      ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11]
      Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an
      amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also
      influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known
      influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to
      classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised
      him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not forestalled by
      predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by
      known or readily surmisable successors".[14]
