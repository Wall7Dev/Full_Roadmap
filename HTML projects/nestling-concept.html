      <li><h1>An Informal Introduction to Python</h1></li>
      <p>
        In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
        presence or absence of prompts <b>(>>> and …):</b> to repeat the
        example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt
        appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the
        interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an
        example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a
        multi-line command.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in
        the upper-right corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and
        output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input
        lines into your interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>Some examples;</p>

      <pre>
        # this is the first comment<br />
        spam = 1 # and this is the second comment<br />
        # ... and now a third! <br />
        text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
      </pre>

        <h2>1.1. Using Python as a Calculator</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait
          for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>1.1.1 Numbers</h3></li>
          <p>
            The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
            expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
            straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / can be used to perform
            arithmetic; parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <b>>>></b> 2 + 2
            4
            <b>>>></b> 50 - 5*6
            20
            <b>>>></b> (50 - 5*6) / 4
            5.0
            <b>>>></b> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
            1.6
          </pre>
          <li>
            <h3>1.1.2. Text</h3>
            <p>
              Python can manipulate text (represented by type str, so-called
              “strings”) as well as numbers. This includes characters “!”, words
              “rabbit”, names “Paris”, sentences “Got your back.”, etc. “Yay!
              :)”. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double
              quotes ("...") with the same result [2].
            </p>
            <pre>
              <b>>>></b> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
              'spam eggs'
              <b>>>></b> "Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!"  # double quotes
              'Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!'
              <b>>>></b> '1975'  # digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings
              '1975'
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>String Indexing</h4>
                <p>
                  Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character
                  having index 0. There is no separate character type; a
                  character is simply a string of size one:
                </p>
                <pre>
                  <b>>>></b> word = 'Python'
                  <b>>>></b> word[0]  # character in position 0
                  'P'
                  <b>>>></b> word[5]  # character in position 5
                  'n'
                </pre>
                <p>
                  Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from
                  the right:
                </p>
                <p>
                  One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices
                  as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the
                  first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last
                  character of a string of n characters has index n, for
                  example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
                  | P | y | t | h | o | n |
                  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
                  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
                 -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
                </pre>
                <p>
                  The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0…6
                  in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative
                  indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters
                  between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the
                  difference of the indices, if both are within bounds. For
                  example, the length of word[1:3] is 2.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                B2a
                <ul>
                  <li>B2aa</li>
                  <li>B2ab</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>B2b</li>
              <li>B2c</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <h3>3.1.3. Lists</h3>
            <p>
              Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group
              together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can
              be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between
              square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but
              usually the items all have the same type.
            </p>
            <pre>
              <b>>>></b> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
              <b>>>></b> squares
              [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
            </pre>
            <p>
              Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be
              indexed and sliced:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>B3.1</li>
              <li>B3.2</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><h3>3.1.3. Lists</h3></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><h2>3.2. First Steps Towards Programming</h2></li>
      <p>
        Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two
        and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of
        the Fibonacci series as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <b>>>></b># Fibonacci series:
        <b...</b> # the sum of two elements defines the next
        <b...</b> a, b = 0, 1
        <b>>>></b> while a < 10:
        <b>...</b>   print(a)
        <b>...</b>   a, b = b, a+b
        <b>...</b>
        0
        1
        1
        2
        3
        5
        8
      </pre>
    </ol>
